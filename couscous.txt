Ingredients:

- 300g couscous
- 300ml hot vegetable or chicken stock
- 250g tub olives and feta cheese in olive oil
- 1 heaped tbsp harissa paste
- 2 x 200g packs falafel
- 290g jar roasted red peppers, drained and thinly sliced
- 300g fat-free yogurt bunch mint, roughly chopped

Method:

1- Put the couscous in a large bowl and pour over the stock. Cover with cling film and leave for 5 mins to swell. Drain the olives and feta, reserving some of the oil. Stir most of the harissa into the couscous with the reserved oil, then season.
2- Tip the couscous onto a platter and scatter over the falafel. Pile the peppers, olives and feta to one side. Mix the yogurt and most of the mint with some seasoning in a small bowl, ripple through the rest of the harissa, and scatter over the remaining mint. Serve with the couscous & falafel salad.
